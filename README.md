# Two-wheeled Car Trajectory Control with Arduino and Mouse Sensor
Controlling a Vehicle With Stepper Motors on a Specific Trajectory: At first, the robotic vehicle was 3D printed using sample files from the thingiverse site. The vehicle was composed of two wheels which included a stepper motor attached to each wheel. Moreover, two Arduino Uno boards were used for the programming of the robot and the initial goal was to follow a specific trajectory with closed loop control. This project was a team effort by myself, Mr. Amirreza Mousavi and Mrs. Shima Shemshaki.
